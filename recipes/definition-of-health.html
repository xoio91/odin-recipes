    <p><strong>Prep Time:</strong> 10 min <strong>Cook Time:</strong> 45 min <strong>Serves:</strong> 4 servings</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 13.4 oz cans chickpeas</li>
        <li>2 bell peppers, diced</li>
        <li>1 cup bulgar wheat</li>
        <li>2 cucumbers</li>
        <li>2 roma tomatoes</li>
        <li>4 stalks scallion</li>
        <li>2 lemons</li>
        <li>0.5 oz fresh dill</li>
        <li>1 cup feta cheese</li>
        <li>8 tablespoon sour cream (substitute with plan Greek yogurt)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon harissa powder</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry produce.</li>
        <li>Core, deseed, and dice bell pepper into ½-inch pieces. Drain and rinse chickpeas; pat very dry with paper towels.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, toss bell pepper and chickpeas with a large drizzle of olive oil, 2 tsp harissa powder, and salt. Divide contents evenly between two baking sheets.</li>
        <li>Roast on top rack until bell pepper is softened and chickpeas are lightly browned, 18-20 minutes. (It’s natural for chickpeas to pop a bit while roasting.)</li>
        <li>While bell pepper and chickpeas roast, in a small pot, combine bulgur, 2 cups water, 1 tsp harissa powder (be sure to measure), and 1 tsp salt.</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce to a low simmer. Cook until water has absorbed and bulgur is tender, 12-15 minutes. Keep covered off heat until ready to use in step 10.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, zest and halve lemon. Trim and finely dice cucumber. Finely dice tomato. Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens; mince whites. Pick and mince fronds from dill.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, whisk together sour cream, 4 TBSP feta, and 1 TBSP olive oil. Add water 1 tsp at a time until mixture reaches a drizzling consistency. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Squeeze juice from 1 lemon into a large bowl. Whisk in 4 TBSP olive oil, 1/4 tsp lemon zest, and 1/2 tsp salt.</li>
        <li>If necessary, drain any excess water from bulgur; stir into bowl along with cucumber, tomato, scallion whites, remaining feta, and minced dill to taste (start with half and add more from there if desired). Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Divide tabbouleh between bowls. Top with roasted bell pepper and chickpeas. Drizzle with feta dressing and sprinkle with scallion greens. Cut remaining lemon into wedges and serve on the side.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
